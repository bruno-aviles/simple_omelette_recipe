## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible using only HTML & CSS. The design must be mobile-friendly as well.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Creating the recipe project enabled me to explore CSS variables and the BEM (Block Element Modifier) approach, while also reinforcing the importance of semantic HTML coding. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding and proficiency in web development techniques.
